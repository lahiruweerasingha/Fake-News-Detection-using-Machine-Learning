The legislation would provide $36.5 billion in emergency relief as Puerto Rico in particular struggles to regain electricity and other basic services following destructive hurricanes. The House of Representatives approved the bill earlier this month. The Trump administration already has indicated it will seek another round of emergency relief from Congress. \",\n          \"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About a thousand Hungarians protested on Friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party Jobbik which has been  threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a  death sentence  for democracy. Despite the gloomy rhetoric and Jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year. Hungarians will vote for a new parliament in April and Prime Minister Viktor Orban s conservative, anti-migrant Fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with Jobbik its nearest rival. Jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against Orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang. Orban, rejecting the charges, says his financial standing is  an open book . Last week the state audit office (ASZ) ruled Jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices, breaching rules on political funding, then it slapped a 663 million forint ($2.5 million) penalty on the party. The protesters, waving Jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite, gathered outside the headquarters of Orban s Fidesz party.  What we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation. It is not an official penalty. This is a death sentence with Jobbik s name on it. But in reality, it is a death sentence for Hungarian democracy,  Jobbiik leader Gabor Vona told the crowd. A government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks. ASZ chairman Laszlo Domokos is a former Fidesz lawmaker, whom Jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of Orban. The audit office denies that. On Friday, ASZ again called on Jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings, saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe. The ruling Fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the ASZ probe.  This case has nothing to do with the election campaign,  Orban aide Janos Lazar said on Thursday. For over a year Fidesz has targeted Jobbik, whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant Fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right, said analyst Zoltan Novak at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis. Gyorgy Illes, a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally, said he used to be a Socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions.  This ASZ probe is a clear sign that Orban is way past any remedy. It is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear. Democracy, the rule of law, equality, you name it,  he said. \",\n          \"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Thursday of interfering in its internal affairs and said it had lodged a complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law an act laying the groundwork for possible U.S. navy visits to self-ruled Taiwan. Tensions have risen in recent days after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits to the island which China claims as its own territory. On Monday, Chinese jets carried out  island encirclement patrols  around Taiwan, with state media showing pictures of bombers with cruise missiles slung under their wings as they carried out the exercise. On Tuesday, Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States. Such visits would be the first since the United States ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 and established ties with Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said while the Taiwan sections of the law were not legally binding, they seriously violate the  One China  policy and  constitute an interference in China s internal affairs .   China is resolutely opposed to this, and we have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. government,  Lu told a daily news briefing. China is firmly opposed to any official exchanges, military contact, or arms sales between Taiwan and the United States, he added.  Proudly democratic Taiwan has become increasingly concerned with the ramped up Chinese military presence, that has included several rounds of Chinese air force drills around the island in recent months.  Taiwan is confident of its defenses and responded quickly to the Chinese air force drills this week, its government said, denouncing the rise in China s military deployments as irresponsible. Taiwan presidential spokesman Alex Huang, speaking to Taiwan media in comments reported late on Wednesday, said the defense ministry had kept a close watch on the patrols and responded immediately and properly. Taiwan  can ensure there are no concerns at all about national security, and people can rest assured , Huang said. Both sides of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan from its giant neighbor, have a responsibility to protect peace and stability, he added.  Such a raised military posture that may impact upon and harm regional peace and stability and cross-strait ties does not give a feeling of responsibility, and the international community does not look favorably upon this,  Huang was quoted as saying. Relations have soured considerably since Tsai Ing-wen, who leads Taiwan s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year. China suspects Tsai wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security. Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S. weapons but has been pressing for more advanced equipment to deal with what it sees as a rising threat from China. The United States is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 716,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"September 2, 2017 \",\n          \"February 2, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

According to the Clinical Trials website, run by the National Institutes of Health, participants must be at least 14 years old and 18-24 weeks pregnant.The controversial study, led by Bliss Kaneshiro, MD and Kate Whitehouse, DO, will monitor bleeding during D&E abortions to determine the effects of the drug oxytocin, commonly used to minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage.The clinical trial, called  Effects of Oxytocin on Bleeding Outcomes during Dilation and Evacuation  began in October 2014 and is a collaboration between UH, Society of Family Planning and the University of Washington.The Society of Family Planning funds a number of similar research projects, such as experimenting with the dosage of Misoprostol, a uterine contracting agent, prior to surgical abortions at 13-18 weeks and exploring umbilical cord injections to produce fetal death prior to late-term abortions.In the UH study, researchers will carry out a  randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,  to determine the effect of oxytocin s use on uterine bleeding, meaning that they will either provide or deny intravenous oxytocin to the women.Reports suggest that some doctors are concerned that withholding oxytocin during surgery may put patients, especially teen girls, at risk. This study is reminiscent of Nazi concentration camp experiments. I pity the poor women who are being treated like lab rats, especially those who are denied the drug to reduce hemorrhaging,  said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.Dilation and evacuation abortions are surgical procedures that involve dismembering the pre-born baby with forceps, scraping the inside of the uterus with a curette to remove any residuals and finally suctioning out the womb to make sure the contents are completely removed.After the abortion, the corpse of the fetus is reassembled and examined to ensure everything was successfully removed and that the abortion was complete.The study is hoping to attract up to 166 test subjects and is expected to conclude in July 2015.Via: Breitbart News\",\n          \"CNN was quick to scoop up Corey Lewandowski after Donald Trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager, but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly.Not only has Lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for Trump, but his defense of the disgraced GOP candidate isn t being received well. Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President. And when people like Lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy, they only make themselves look equally foolish.You can watch the embarrassing video below:Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"A Michigan woman decided to defend against tyranny? when she and another shopper couldn t agree over who got to buy the last notebook on the shelf at the Novi Towne Center store.According to ABC 13, the brawl   yes, brawl    involved two Farmington Hills residents, ages 46 and 32, and a mother and daughter from South Lyon, ages 51 and 20. In other words, these were all grown adults who should have known better but hey   there was only one notebook on the shelf, and we ve all seen what happens in those post-apocalyptic movies when a store is down to the last gallon of milk, right?Two of the women, one of whom was the unnamed 20-year-old, reached for the notebook at the same time. The 46 and 32-year-olds apparently decided that she wasn t getting their goddamn notebook and began pulling her hair.Then, because this had almost hit peak  trailer park,  the 20-year-old s mother decided to go for bonus points by pulling out her gun. Fortunately, someone pushed her aside before she could do any harm.This is one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  (conservatives can t dismiss this one, as it is confirmed that she is a concealed carry permit holder)   ready to leap into action at the most minor sign of danger and make things worse by turning the situation potentially deadly.Watch it happen below:Featured image via screengrab\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jun 5, 2015\",\n          \"August 28, 2016\",\n          \"June 3, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

You can t make this stuff up. And now the picture is circulating on social media.In the image, a North Korean soldier can be seen on the right-hand corner of the picture peering in through a window and photographing Tillerson and a US Army general, Business Insider reports.The photo was taken inside the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which was created after the Korean War on what is now the most heavily armed border in the world, and obviously the most spied upon.NBC reporter Brad Jaffy tweeted out a version of the photo, which he zoomed in on, calling it  Rear Window. Rear Window: North Korean soldier takes a photo of Rex Tillerson at the DMZ pic.twitter.com/EHCIR3Fjo6  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 17, 2017The original photo can be seen here.Tillerson announced on Friday at a news conference in Seoul that military action against North Korea is  an option  if the threat from its nuclear weapons program rises to a level  that we believe requires action. Tillerson told reporters that  all of the options are on the table. According to the Korea Herald, Tillerson cut his recent visit short with South Korean officials due to  fatigue. The newspaper reported that Tillerson did not have lunch or dinner with South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn during his visit there.Tillerson spent several hours meeting with Japanese officials, which included dinner meetings, the paper noted, according to The Hill.The secretary of State reportedly did hold talks with both South Korean officials regarding the threat posed by North Korea s nuclear program.And that must have been before  fatigue  set in. On Twitter, Trump said that North Korea was  behaving very badly. South Korea s Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye in March over a corruption scandal. In contrast, the U.S. has failed to address its newly minted president s growing list of scandals. Tillerson, too, has his own scandal to deal with.As for the North Korean soldier spying on Tillerson, perhaps if he wore spy glasses and a fake mustache no one would have noticed. The soldier has better access to the Secretary of State than U.S. reporters do.Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.\",\n          \"Join Patrick every week here at 21WIRE.TV for news, views and analysis on all top stories domestically and abroad THIS WEEK: Episode 4 The New World Order  Did Great Britain regain control of its former American colonies by stealth?

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit granted a motion filed by the 16 attorneys general, led by California\\u2019s Xavier Becerra and New York\\u2019s Eric Schneiderman. President Donald Trump, frustrated that he and fellow Republicans in Congress have been unable to keep campaign promises to repeal and replace Obamacare, has threatened to stop making the so-called cost-sharing subsidy, or CSR, payments. \\u201cThe President is working with his staff and his cabinet to consider the issues raised by the CSR payments,\\u201d a White House statement said. The subsidies help cover out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income Americans. The case, which dates back to administration of President Barack Obama, was filed by the Republican-led House of Representatives against the federal government in an effort to block the subsidy payments to insurers for the individual plans created by the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. The court\\u2019s order allows Democrats who back the law to have a say in the legal fight, giving them the power to block a settlement or appeal a ruling blocking the payments. They can also file briefs and their lawyers can participate in oral arguments. \\u201cThe court\\u2019s decision is good news for the hundreds of thousands of New York families that rely on these subsidies for their health care. It\\u2019s disturbingly clear that President Trump and his administration are willing to treat them as political pawns,\\u201d Schneiderman said in a statement. \\u201cIf Donald Trump won\\u2019t defend these vital subsidies for American families, then we will,\\u201d Becerra said. The order issued by the three-judge panel, all Obama appointees, said the states had shown \\u201ca substantial risk that an injunction requiring termination of the payments at issue here ... would lead directly and imminently to an increase in insurance prices, which in turn will increase the number of uninsured individuals for whom the states will have to provide health care.\\u201d \\u201cIn addition, state-funded hospitals will suffer financially when they are unable to recoup costs from uninsured, indigent patients for whom federal law requires them to provide medical care,\\u201d the court order said. Nicholas Bagley, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, said the decision was a \\u201cbig deal\\u201d because it makes it difficult for the Trump administration to settle the case. \\u201cAllowing the states to intervene will increase the pressure on the administration to keep making the cost-sharing payments,\\u201d he said, noting that the administration could still stop making the payments. Trump has repeatedly threatened to withhold the payments to insurers, which amount to about $7 billion this year, and referred to them as a \\u201cbailout.\\u201d The attorneys general cited in their May court filing Trump\\u2019s own words vowing to let Obamacare \\u201cexplode\\u201d as part of the reasoning for their intervention.    The case is currently on hold at the request of both sides. The expectation had been that the case would be dismissed because the Republican-controlled Congress was poised to repeal the Obamacare law. But that effort failed last week, meaning the court case has taken on renewed importance. U.S. health insurer Anthem Inc is pulling back from 16 of 19 pricing regions in California where it offered Obamacare options this year in part due to uncertainty over the payments, state officials said on Tuesday. \",\n          \"World-renowned political theorist and activist Noam Chomsky has made his feelings about Donald Trump very publicly known when he openly called Trump a  clown  a few months ago   and his message to America is now more urgent than ever.In a piece posted on AlterNet, Chomsky speaks directly to progressives in swing states that aren t fond of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton or Trump. Chomsky himself isn t completely pro-Hillary   he is actually quite critical of her on certain things like foreign policy   but he makes an eight-point argument that Trump is such a danger to this country, progressives would be smart to vote for the  lesser evil. In fact, Chomsky flat-out says that voting for Clinton could very well save the planet because Trump is such a major threat to not only Americans, but the entire world. In his piece, Chomsky points out that on the subject of climate change alone, Trump is deadly. He said: One of these candidates, Trump, denies the existence of global warming, calls for increasing use of fossil fuels, dismantling of environmental regulations and refuses assistance to India and other developing nations as called for in the Paris agreement, the combination of which could, in four years, take us to a catastrophic tipping point. And Chomsky hadn t even addressed the fact that Trump continuously insults other countries, doesn t have an ounce of empathy in his bones, and is not emotionally stable enough to be trusted with the codes to nuclear weapons. However, Chomsky s major take-away here is that in this election, Americans shouldn t see voting as a moral act   at this point, we need to do whatever we can to prevent a devastating outcome: Trump in the White House. Chomsky wrote: Voting should not be viewed as a form of personal self-expression or moral judgement directed in retaliation towards major party candidates who fail to reflect our values, or of a corrupt system designed to limit choices to those acceptable to corporate elites. Chomsky reached out to progressives in particular when he said: The left should also recognize that, should Trump win based on its failure to support Clinton, it will repeatedly face the accusation (based in fact), that it lacks concern for those sure to be most victimized by a Trump administration. You can read Chomsky s entire piece here. This of course, is hardly the first time Chomsky has urged Americans to come to their senses about Trump.

(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday voiced support for Roy Moore, the Alabama Republican Senate candidate dogged by accusations of sexual misconduct, during a rally that foreshadowed themes for next year\\u2019s midterm elections. Trump, speaking to a stadium of supporters in Pensacola, Florida, near the Alabama state line, touted his work to quit or renegotiate trade deals and called on Democrats to support a measure that would avert a government shutdown. Trump highlighted familiar themes from his political rallies: criticism of violence in Chicago, which he suggested was less safe than Afghanistan, as well as his commitment to improving U.S. border security and to crack down on immigration. But he made a point of using the rally to note his desire to get Moore elected. \\u201cGet out and vote for Roy Moore,\\u201d Trump said ahead of Tuesday\\u2019s election. The race in the heavily Republican state heated up last month with accusations that Moore sexually assaulted or behaved inappropriately with several women when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. Moore, a conservative Christian and former state judge, denies the allegations, and Trump formally endorsed him on Monday. \\u201cWe cannot afford - this country, the future of this country - cannot afford to lose a seat in the very, very close United States Senate,\\u201d Trump said. Republicans hold a slim 52-48 majority in the Senate.  Trump said Moore\\u2019s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, is a \\u201ctotal puppet\\u201d of Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. \\u201cHe will never, ever vote for us. We need somebody in that Senate seat who will vote for our Make America Great Again agenda,\\u201d Trump said. Moore\\u2019s race against Jones, a former attorney, has come amid an array of allegations of sexual misconduct that have brought down men in media, politics, and entertainment. U.S. Senator Al Franken said on Thursday he would resign in the coming weeks after allegations of sexual misconduct. Franken said it was ironic that he was leaving while Moore campaigned with backing of his party and Trump, who last year faced allegations of sexual misconduct, remained in the Oval Office. Trump\\u2019s support for Moore puts him at odds with other lawmakers in the Republican Party, particularly Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. In his speech, Trump did not directly address the sexual harassment allegations against Moore, but he mocked the fact that one of Moore\\u2019s accusers acknowledged on Friday that part of an inscription that she had said Moore had written in her high school yearbook was in fact penned by her. \\u201cDid you see what happened today? You know, the yearbook? ... There was a little mistake made - she started writing things in the yearbook,\\u201d Trump said. The accuser, Beverly Young Nelson, said last month Moore sexually assaulted her when she was 16 and he was a prosecuting attorney in his 30s. Moore denies ever having known Nelson. Nelson says the yearbook entry shows that they were acquainted. Nelson\\u2019s attorney Gloria Allred said on Friday a handwriting analysis had concluded that Moore had signed the yearbook. The White House reiterated on Friday that Moore had denied the accusations against him. \\u201cWe find these allegations to be troubling and concerning, and they should be taken seriously. Roy Moore has also maintained that these allegations aren\\u2019t true, and that should also be taken into account,\\u201d White House spokesman Raj Shah told reporters on Air Force One during Trump\\u2019s flight to Florida. After initially abandoning Moore, the Republican Party resumed contributing funding to his election effort after Trump\\u2019s endorsement. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit granted a motion filed by the 16 attorneys general, led by California\\u2019s Xavier Becerra and New York\\u2019s Eric Schneiderman. President Donald Trump, frustrated that he and fellow Republicans in Congress have been unable to keep campaign promises to repeal and replace Obamacare, has threatened to stop making the so-called cost-sharing subsidy, or CSR, payments. \\u201cThe President is working with his staff and his cabinet to consider the issues raised by the CSR payments,\\u201d a White House statement said. The subsidies help cover out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income Americans. The case, which dates back to administration of President Barack Obama, was filed by the Republican-led House of Representatives against the federal government in an effort to block the subsidy payments to insurers for the individual plans created by the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. The court\\u2019s order allows Democrats who back the law to have a say in the legal fight, giving them the power to block a settlement or appeal a ruling blocking the payments. They can also file briefs and their lawyers can participate in oral arguments. \\u201cThe court\\u2019s decision is good news for the hundreds of thousands of New York families that rely on these subsidies for their health care. It\\u2019s disturbingly clear that President Trump and his administration are willing to treat them as political pawns,\\u201d Schneiderman said in a statement. \\u201cIf Donald Trump won\\u2019t defend these vital subsidies for American families, then we will,\\u201d Becerra said. The order issued by the three-judge panel, all Obama appointees, said the states had shown \\u201ca substantial risk that an injunction requiring termination of the payments at issue here ... would lead directly and imminently to an increase in insurance prices, which in turn will increase the number of uninsured individuals for whom the states will have to provide health care.\\u201d \\u201cIn addition, state-funded hospitals will suffer financially when they are unable to recoup costs from uninsured, indigent patients for whom federal law requires them to provide medical care,\\u201d the court order said. Nicholas Bagley, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, said the decision was a \\u201cbig deal\\u201d because it makes it difficult for the Trump administration to settle the case. \\u201cAllowing the states to intervene will increase the pressure on the administration to keep making the cost-sharing payments,\\u201d he said, noting that the administration could still stop making the payments. Trump has repeatedly threatened to withhold the payments to insurers, which amount to about $7 billion this year, and referred to them as a \\u201cbailout.\\u201d The attorneys general cited in their May court filing Trump\\u2019s own words vowing to let Obamacare \\u201cexplode\\u201d as part of the reasoning for their intervention.    The case is currently on hold at the request of both sides. The expectation had been that the case would be dismissed because the Republican-controlled Congress was poised to repeal the Obamacare law. But that effort failed last week, meaning the court case has taken on renewed importance. U.S. health insurer Anthem Inc is pulling back from 16 of 19 pricing regions in California where it offered Obamacare options this year in part due to uncertainty over the payments, state officials said on Tuesday. \",\n          \"World-renowned political theorist and activist Noam Chomsky has made his feelings about Donald Trump very publicly known when he openly called Trump a  clown  a few months ago   and his message to America is now more urgent than ever.In a piece posted on AlterNet, Chomsky speaks directly to progressives in swing states that aren t fond of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton or Trump. Chomsky himself isn t completely pro-Hillary   he is actually quite critical of her on certain things like foreign policy   but he makes an eight-point argument that Trump is such a danger to this country, progressives would be smart to vote for the  lesser evil. In fact, Chomsky flat-out says that voting for Clinton could very well save the planet because Trump is such a major threat to not only Americans, but the entire world. In his piece, Chomsky points out that on the subject of climate change alone, Trump is deadly. He said: One of these candidates, Trump, denies the existence of global warming, calls for increasing use of fossil fuels, dismantling of environmental regulations and refuses assistance to India and other developing nations as called for in the Paris agreement, the combination of which could, in four years, take us to a catastrophic tipping point. And Chomsky hadn t even addressed the fact that Trump continuously insults other countries, doesn t have an ounce of empathy in his bones, and is not emotionally stable enough to be trusted with the codes to nuclear weapons. However, Chomsky s major take-away here is that in this election, Americans shouldn t see voting as a moral act   at this point, we need to do whatever we can to prevent a devastating outcome: Trump in the White House. Chomsky wrote: Voting should not be viewed as a form of personal self-expression or moral judgement directed in retaliation towards major party candidates who fail to reflect our values, or of a corrupt system designed to limit choices to those acceptable to corporate elites. Chomsky reached out to progressives in particular when he said: The left should also recognize that, should Trump win based on its failure to support Clinton, it will repeatedly face the accusation (based in fact), that it lacks concern for those sure to be most victimized by a Trump administration. You can read Chomsky s entire piece here. This of course, is hardly the first time Chomsky has urged Americans to come to their senses about Trump.

(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday voiced support for Roy Moore, the Alabama Republican Senate candidate dogged by accusations of sexual misconduct, during a rally that foreshadowed themes for next year\\u2019s midterm elections. Trump, speaking to a stadium of supporters in Pensacola, Florida, near the Alabama state line, touted his work to quit or renegotiate trade deals and called on Democrats to support a measure that would avert a government shutdown. Trump highlighted familiar themes from his political rallies: criticism of violence in Chicago, which he suggested was less safe than Afghanistan, as well as his commitment to improving U.S. border security and to crack down on immigration. But he made a point of using the rally to note his desire to get Moore elected. \\u201cGet out and vote for Roy Moore,\\u201d Trump said ahead of Tuesday\\u2019s election. The race in the heavily Republican state heated up last month with accusations that Moore sexually assaulted or behaved inappropriately with several women when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. Moore, a conservative Christian and former state judge, denies the allegations, and Trump formally endorsed him on Monday. \\u201cWe cannot afford - this country, the future of this country - cannot afford to lose a seat in the very, very close United States Senate,\\u201d Trump said. Republicans hold a slim 52-48 majority in the Senate.  Trump said Moore\\u2019s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, is a \\u201ctotal puppet\\u201d of Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. \\u201cHe will never, ever vote for us. We need somebody in that Senate seat who will vote for our Make America Great Again agenda,\\u201d Trump said. Moore\\u2019s race against Jones, a former attorney, has come amid an array of allegations of sexual misconduct that have brought down men in media, politics, and entertainment. U.S. Senator Al Franken said on Thursday he would resign in the coming weeks after allegations of sexual misconduct. Franken said it was ironic that he was leaving while Moore campaigned with backing of his party and Trump, who last year faced allegations of sexual misconduct, remained in the Oval Office. Trump\\u2019s support for Moore puts him at odds with other lawmakers in the Republican Party, particularly Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. In his speech, Trump did not directly address the sexual harassment allegations against Moore, but he mocked the fact that one of Moore\\u2019s accusers acknowledged on Friday that part of an inscription that she had said Moore had written in her high school yearbook was in fact penned by her. \\u201cDid you see what happened today? You know, the yearbook? ... There was a little mistake made - she started writing things in the yearbook,\\u201d Trump said. The accuser, Beverly Young Nelson, said last month Moore sexually assaulted her when she was 16 and he was a prosecuting attorney in his 30s. Moore denies ever having known Nelson. Nelson says the yearbook entry shows that they were acquainted. Nelson\\u2019s attorney Gloria Allred said on Friday a handwriting analysis had concluded that Moore had signed the yearbook. The White House reiterated on Friday that Moore had denied the accusations against him. \\u201cWe find these allegations to be troubling and concerning, and they should be taken seriously. Roy Moore has also maintained that these allegations aren\\u2019t true, and that should also be taken into account,\\u201d White House spokesman Raj Shah told reporters on Air Force One during Trump\\u2019s flight to Florida. After initially abandoning Moore, the Republican Party resumed contributing funding to his election effort after Trump\\u2019s endorsement. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

his cabinet to consider the issues raised by the csr payments a white house statement said the subsidies help cover outofpocket medical expenses for lowincome americans the case which dates back to administration of president barack obama was filed by the republicanled house of representatives against the federal government in an effort to block the subsidy payments to insurers for the individual plans created by the affordable care act popularly known as obamacare the courts order allows democrats who back the law to have a say in the legal fight giving them the power to block a settlement or appeal a ruling blocking the payments they can also file briefs and their lawyers can participate in oral arguments the courts decision is good news for the hundreds of thousands of new york families that rely on these subsidies for their health care its disturbingly clear that president trump and his administration are willing to treat them as political pawns schneiderman said in a statement if donald trump wont defend these vital subsidies for american families then we will becerra said the order issued by the threejudge panel all obama appointees said the states had shown a substantial risk that an injunction requiring termination of the payments at issue here  would lead directly and imminently to an increase in insurance prices which in turn will increase the number of uninsured individuals for whom the states will have to provide health care in addition statefunded hospitals will suffer financially when they are unable to recoup costs from uninsured indigent patients for whom federal law requires them to provide medical care the court order said nicholas bagley a professor at the university of michigan law school said the decision was a big deal because it makes it difficult for the trump administration to settle the case allowing the states to intervene will increase the pressure on the administration to keep making the costsharing payments he said noting that the administration could still stop making the payments trump has repeatedly threatened to withhold the payments to insurers which amount to about  billion this year and referred to them as a bailout the attorneys general cited in their may court filing trumps own words vowing to let obamacare explode as part of the reasoning for their intervention    the case is currently on hold at the request of both sides the expectation had been that the case would be dismissed because the republicancontrolled congress was poised to repeal the obamacare law but that effort failed last week meaning the court case has taken on renewed importance us health insurer anthem inc is pulling back from  of  pricing regions in california where it offered obamacare options this year in part due to uncertainty over the payments state officials said on tuesday \",\n          \"worldrenowned political theorist and activist noam chomsky has made his feelings about donald trump very publicly known when he openly called trump a  clown  a few months ago   and his message to america is now more urgent than everin a piece posted on alternet chomsky speaks directly to progressives in swing states that aren t fond of democratic nominee hillary clinton or trump chomsky himself isn t completely prohillary   he is actually quite critical of her on certain things like foreign policy   but he makes an eightpoint argument that trump is such a danger to this country progressives would be smart to vote for the  lesser evil in fact chomsky flatout says that voting for clinton could very well save the planet because trump is such a major threat to not only americans but the entire world in his piece chomsky points out that on the subject of climate change alone trump is deadly he said one of these candidates trump denies the existence of global warming calls for increasing use of fossil fuels dismantling of environmental regulations and refuses assistance to india and other developing nations as called for in the paris agreement the combination of which could in four years take us to a catastrophic tipping point and chomsky hadn t even addressed the fact that trump continuously insults other countries doesn t have an ounce of empathy in his bones and is not emotionally stable enough to be trusted with the codes to nuclear weapons however chomsky s major takeaway here is that in this election americans shouldn t see voting as a moral act   at this point we need to do whatever we can to prevent a devastating outcome trump in the white house chomsky wrote voting should not be viewed as a form of personal selfexpression or moral judgement directed in retaliation towards major party candidates who fail to reflect our values or of a corrupt system designed to limit choices to those acceptable to corporate elites chomsky reached out to progressives in particular when he said the left should also recognize that should trump win based on its failure to support clinton it will repeatedly face the accusation based in fact that it lacks concern for those sure to be most victimized by a trump administration you can read chomsky s entire piece here this of course is hardly the first time chomsky has urged americans to come to their senses about trump you can watch the famed linguist talk about trump at length in the video belowfeatured image via william b plowman and scott eisen  getty images\",\n          \"pensacola fla reuters  us president donald trump on friday voiced support for roy moore the alabama republican senate candidate dogged by accusations of sexual misconduct during a rally that foreshadowed themes for next years midterm elections trump speaking to a stadium of supporters in pensacola florida near the alabama state line touted his work to quit or renegotiate trade deals and called on democrats to support a measure that would avert a government shutdown trump highlighted familiar themes from his political rallies criticism of violence in chicago which he suggested was less safe than afghanistan as well as his commitment to improving us border security and to crack down on immigration but he made a point of using the rally to note his desire to get moore elected get out and vote for roy moore trump said ahead of tuesdays election the race in the heavily republican state heated up last month with accusations that moore sexually assaulted or behaved inappropriately with several women when they were teenagers and he was in his s moore a conservative christian and former state judge denies the allegations and trump formally endorsed him on monday we cannot afford  this country the future of this country  cannot afford to lose a seat in the very very close united states senate trump said republicans hold a slim  majority in the senate  trump said moores democratic opponent doug jones is a total puppet of senate democratic leader chuck schumer and house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi he will never ever vote for us we need somebody in that senate seat who will vote for our make america great again agenda trump said moores race against jones a former attorney has come amid an array of allegations of sexual misconduct that have brought down men in media politics and entertainment us senator al franken said on thursday he would resign in the coming weeks after allegations of sexual misconduct franken said it was ironic that he was leaving while moore campaigned with backing of his party and trump who last year faced allegations of sexual misconduct remained in the oval office trumps support for moore puts him at odds with other lawmakers in the republican party particularly senate majority leader mitch mcconnell in his speech trump did not directly address the sexual harassment allegations against moore but he mocked the fact that one of moores accusers acknowledged on friday that part of an inscription that she had said moore had written in her high school yearbook was in fact penned by her did you see what happened today you know the yearbook  there was a little mistake made  she started writing things in the yearbook trump said the accuser beverly young nelson said last month moore sexually assaulted her when she was  and he was a prosecuting attorney in his s moore denies ever having known nelson nelson says the yearbook entry shows that they were acquainted nelsons attorney gloria allred said on friday a handwriting analysis had concluded that moore had signed the yearbook the white house reiterated on friday that moore had denied the accusations against him we find these allegations to be troubling and concerning and they should be taken seriously roy moore has also maintained that these allegations arent true and that should also be taken into account white house spokesman raj shah told reporters on air force one during trumps flight to florida after initially abandoning moore the republican party resumed contributing funding to his election effort after trumps endorsement \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\":

            "In an unexpected turn of events, astronomers from around the globe have reported unusual activity in the cosmos that could indicate a looming alien invasion. The discovery, made during routine observations of distant galaxies, has sent shockwaves through the scientific community and sparked widespread concern among the general public.  The first signs of trouble emerged late last week when astronomers at the renowned Kepler Space Observatory detected a series of peculiar radio signals emanating from a remote corner of the universe. Initial analysis of the signals revealed patterns that defied conventional explanations, leading experts to speculate that they could be of extraterrestrial origin.  Dr. Sarah Johnson, lead researcher at the Kepler Observatory, described the discovery as \"both thrilling and terrifying.\" \"We've been searching for signs of intelligent life beyond our solar system for decades, but this is the first time we've encountered anything quite like this,\" she said in a press conference held earlier today.  As news of the discovery spread, governments around the world scrambled to assess the situation and formulate a response. President Jonathan Hayes convened an emergency meeting of the National Security Council to discuss the potential threat posed by the mysterious signals.  \"We cannot afford to underestimate the significance of this discovery,\" President Hayes declared in a televised address to the nation. \"While we remain hopeful that these signals are benign in nature, we must be prepared for all eventualities.\"  Speculation about the nature and intentions of the hypothetical extraterrestrial civilization responsible for the signals has run rampant on social media and internet forums. Some have speculated that the aliens could be benevolent beings seeking to establish peaceful contact with humanity, while others have raised concerns about the possibility of hostile intentions.  In light of the uncertainty surrounding the situation, governments around the world have begun implementing precautionary measures to ensure the safety and security of their citizens. Military forces have been placed on high alert, and emergency response teams have been mobilized to deal with any potential threats.  Despite the prevailing sense of apprehension, there are those who remain optimistic about the prospects of contact with an alien civilization. Dr. Mark Rodriguez, a renowned astrophysicist and advocate for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, expressed hope that the discovery could mark the beginning of a new era of interstellar cooperation.  \"We have long dreamed of making contact with another intelligent civilization,\" Dr. Rodriguez said in a statement to the press. \"While there are undoubtedly risks involved, the potential benefits of establishing peaceful relations with an advanced alien species are incalculable.\"  As the world awaits further developments, one thing is clear: humanity stands on the brink of a historic encounter that could reshape the course of our collective destiny. Whether the signals from deep space herald the dawn of a new era of exploration and cooperation or the onset of a cataclysmic conflict remains to be seen.\n"
